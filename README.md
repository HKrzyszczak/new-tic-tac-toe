## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a simple, two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns placing their symbol, either an X or an O, in a blank space on the grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.
